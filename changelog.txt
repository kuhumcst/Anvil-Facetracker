1) Better policy for saving face tracker settings in Anvil file.
2) Disabling/enabling of face tracker controls that are (ir)relevant under
given circumstances. For example, setting threshold is disabled if the user
has chosen to annotate every frame. (For later machine learning purpose.)

1) Annotation of "jerk" (third time derivative of position) in addition to 
   "velocity" (first derivative) and "acceleration" (second derivative).
2) Different default periods: velocity 7 frames, acceleration 14 frames and
   jerk 21 frames.
3) Can create annotations for each and every frame, as long as there is data.
   (Perhaps) useful for machine learning. The frame's point in time is halfway
   the beginning and the end of the current time frame.
4) New track-spec for faceJerk
